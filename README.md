# ruby_raider
This is a gem to make setup and start of UI automation projects easier

Just do:

**gem install ruby_raider**

then do: 

**raider [name_of_project]** 

and you will have a new project in the folder you are in

Currently we only support:

* Gerating a Selenium with both Cucumber and Rspec framework
* Gerating a Watir with both Cucumber and Rspec framework
* Generating an Appium project with Rspec on IOS

This works in all the platforms (Tested on Mac OS, Linux and Windows)

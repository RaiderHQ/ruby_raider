# ruby_raider
This is a gem to make setup and start of UI automation projects easier

Just do:

gem install ruby_raider

then do raider [name_of_project] 

and you will have a new project in the folder you are in

Currently we only support Watir with Rspec.

We have only tested this in mac and linux, so it works in both platforms.

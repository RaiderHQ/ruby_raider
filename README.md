# ruby_raider
This is a gem to make setup and start of UI automation projects easier

In order to run ruby raider you need to run the executable,
after you can select the automation framework of your choice and the test framework of your choice.

Currently we only support Watir with Rspec.

We have only tested this in mac and linux, so it works in both platforms.

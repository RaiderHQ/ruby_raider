###### Anything between square brackets([...]) is where your imput goes

  raider new [PROJECT_NAME]         # Creates a new framework based on settings picked

  raider open_ai [REQUEST]          # Uses open AI to create a file or generate output

  raider page [PAGE_NAME]           # Creates a new page object

  raider path [PATH]                # Sets the default path for scaffolding

  raider platform [PLATFORM]        # Sets the default platform for a cross-platform project

  raider raid                       # Runs all the tests in a project

  raider scaffold [SCAFFOLD_NAME]   # Generates everything needed to start automating

  raider spec [SPEC_NAME]           # Creates a new spec

  raider url [URL]                  # Sets the default url for a project

  raider version                    # It shows the version of Ruby Raider you are currently using
```

Ruby raider also supports scaffolding:

* To create a new page object you do: ```raider page [PAGE_NAME]```
* To create a new spec you do: ```raider spec [SPEC_NAME]```
* To create a new feature you do: ```raider feature [FEATURE_NAME]```

It's possible to add the option --path or -p if you want to specify where to create your features, pages, helpers and
specs.

If you want to set the default path for the creation of your features, helpers and specs:

```ruby
raider path [PATH_NAME] --feature or -f
raider path [PATH_NAME] --spec or -s
raider path [PATH_NAME] --helper or -h
```

If you don't specify an option, path will assume you want to change the default path for pages.

### Open AI Commands

If you want to set the default path for the creation of your features, helpers and specs:

```ruby
# Will print the result of the request on the terminal
raider open_ai [REQUEST]
# Will create a file with the result of your request as content
raider open_ai [REQUEST] --path or -p [PATH]
# Will input the content of the chosen file into open ai and will edit it based on the result
raider path [PATH_NAME] --edit or -e [FILE_PATH]
```
